# Simple Shell

A simulation of Shell and some of its functions

## Overview

This project encompases a decent portion of wha the standard SHELL program is capable of

## Elements:

Shell Loop - A shell loop is a control structure used to repeat a block of commands multiple times.

Read Command - The read command is used to take input from the user and store it in a variable.

Parse Command - Parsing a command means breaking it down into parts that the shell can understand and execute.

Execute Command - Executing a command means running it in the shell.

Handle Builtins - Shell builtins are commands that are built into the shell itself, rather than being external programs.

Builtin Exit - The exit builtin is used to exit the current shell or script.

Builtin Environment - The "builtin environment" refers to environment variables that are set up by the shell and are
accessible to all processes spawned by it.
